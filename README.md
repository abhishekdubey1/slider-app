Hi,

Please find the assignment below.

You need to create a slideshow with left and right arrows.

1. 5 slides with unique background images.
2. Text overlay on each of the slides. The text overlay should cover 30% of the screen from the left.
3. With the click of arrows, the slide changes. The arrows will be placed on the right bottom.
4. There will be background audio for each slide.
5. Background, text overlay, left and right arrows, background audio, each of these 4 will be different react components which will be called in one index page.
6. Compatible on mobile. On mobile, the text overlay covers 30% of the screen from the bottom just above the arrows.
